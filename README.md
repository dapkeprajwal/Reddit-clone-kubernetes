# Project: Reddit Clone Application

# Description 

As part of a software development project, I designed and implemented a robust continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD) pipeline for a Reddit clone application. The pipeline incorporated Docker, Docker Hub, and Kubernetes technologies to achieve a seamless, automated flow from code changes to deployment.

# Technologies Used: 

Docker, Docker Hub, Kubernetes, CI/CD, Containerization, Automation, Monitoring, Logging, Reddit Clone Application.

# Dockerfile 

Create a Dockerfile to build application 

docker biuld . -t dapkeprajwal/reddit-clone-app 

Then push app folder to dockerhub with :

docker push dapkeprajwal/reddit-clone-app:latest

# Deployments
 create a kubernetes manifest file using yml to craete deployment
 
 In deployment use replica for load balancing
